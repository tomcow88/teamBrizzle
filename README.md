README

The Pawtrait Purrfectionist website is designed to market our artist, whose focus is portraits of pets. We intend users to use the site as a stepping stone to commissioning our artist to paint their own pet's purrfect pawtrait.

## Features 

Landing/Home page: A full cover high quality background  of one of our artist’s finest portraits, with a brief sentence overlaid, describing the services offered by our website. Pen feature takes user to contact form with placeholder text encouraging them to take out a commission.

## UX

<strong>Site Goals</strong>

The Pawtrait Purrfectionist (aka Luna Felix) website is designed to market our artist, whose focus is portraits of pets. We intend users to use the site as a stepping stone to commissioning our artist to paint their own pet's purrfect pawtrait.


<strong>Design Choices</strong>

We selected a captivating comic book style, using bright high contrast colours, based on Luna's distinctive style of portrait painting. This means there would be stylistic continuity between the gallery of her work, as well as the portraits that provide the background images on all pages of the website.


<strong>Wire Frames</strong>

## Features Left to Implement

We considered adding a price structure but assigned it a "wont have" on our kanban board, as it would be difficult to implement in the time available given the need for payment processing options etc, and potentially seen as gauche and detract from the value of the artist's work, having reviewed other artist's websites e.g.https://www.rayhart.com/rayhart

Considered a reviews section but defined it as a "won't have" given the time available. We felt that also it may appear somewhat gauche on an artistic website, and there were links to social media should provide access to reviews if desired by the user.

Phone number and email address not interactive which would be nice but ran out of time

Hover feature on social media links
