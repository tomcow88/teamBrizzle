Peter Brown's README

The Pawtrait Purrfectionist website is designed to market our artist, whose focus is portraits of pets. We intend users to use the site as a stepping stone to commissioning our artist to paint their own pet's purrfect pawtrait, [or use their work in an exhibition.?]

## Features 

The landing page will be a full cover high quality portrait of one of our artist’s finest portraits, with a brief sentence overlaid, encapsulating our artist’s background and philosophy.

There will be a Gallery section, which will display our artist’s pet portrait portfolio in high quality images. This will assure the user the artist can provide high quality, uniquely stylised, portraits of their own pets. [Or alternatively that their work would be suitable for an exhibition?] 

There will be an About the Artist page which will elaborate on the philosophy and background of our artist, and explain how they began on their journey to become the Pawtrait Purrfectionist.

The website will provide a contact page, which will allow users to contact our artist directly using a contact form, and move easily towards commissioning their own pet portrait. To move the client towards point of sale he form will have the text above it “Interested in commissioning me for your pet’s portrait? Or any other questions, please fill out the form below!”

A header with links to the other pages of the website will be fixed and identical across all pages to provide consistency and ease of navigation and prevent extra clicks being required to go home and then forward again.

There will be a fixed footer across all pages which will provide links to the artist’s social media accounts and their email and phone number to provide ease of access from the first page. It will also provide d provide further evidence of the artist's work, and the ability to gather reviews from others and provide further engagement.


Our artist’s philosophy
At the Pawtrait Purrfectionist, we believe that pets are as much a family member as any human family member! Our artist has always loved animals. Though never allowed a pet themselves, as a child they would volunteer at dog kennels and cat sanctuaries every weekend. During quiet times our artist would do doodles of the pets. These increased in detail until they felt brave enough to give them as free gifts to owners when they came to collect their pets.  Before long the “doodles” were so good that owners insisted on paying for them, and that is when the pawtrait purrfectionist was born.

Inspired by Gaudi and Picasso, our artist developed a distinctive style that captures the unique and colourful essence of the pet without veering into the indignity of cartoonish.


### Features Left to Implement

We would have considered adding a price structure but assigned it a "wont have" on our kanban board, as it would be difficult to implement in the time available given the need for payment processing options etc, and potentially seen as gauche and detract from the value of the artist's work, having reviewed other artist's websites e.g.https://www.rayhart.com/rayhart

Considered a reviews section but defined it as a "won't have" given the time available. We felt that also it may appear somewhat gauche on an artistic website, and there were links to social media should provide access to reviews if desired by the user.
